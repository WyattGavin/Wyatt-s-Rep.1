# Wyatt-s-Rep.1

this is just a template for my web design to i can get a default layout.

this design includes a responsive layout of the following

-- no icons
-- all made in css and html
-- very small amounts of reactive js
-- simple yet complex format
-- readable

definetly a good starter and basic demo of how websites should be formatted
