this is just a template for my web design so i can get a default layout.

this design includes a responsive layout of the following

-- no icons <br>
-- all made in css and html <br>
-- very small amounts of reactive js <br>
-- simple yet complex format <br>
-- readable

definetly a good starter and basic demo of how websites should be formatted

<h3>updates</h3>

currently working on the overall style and layout of the basic website design
